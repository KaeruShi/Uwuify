An android application to customize your boring Android UI.

Iconify was mainly created to change the system icons of any aosp rom. But then I got bored of using substratum. Picking and installing overlays one by one without any previews made me frustrated. So I decided to make it easier for me by creating an application where I can one click change anything I want. This was totally for my personal use but as people showed interest, I decided to release it in public.

## Features

What you can change using Iconify:

- Solid or Gradient Colors

- System Icon Packs

- Brightness Bar Style

- QS Tile Shapes

- QS Panel Row & Column

- QS Panel Icon & Text Color & Size

- Notification Background Style

- Media Player Background Color

- And many more to come...
